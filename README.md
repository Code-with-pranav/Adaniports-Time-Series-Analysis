## Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project contains information related to **Adani Ports**, which includes key time-based metrics for analysis. 

- **Data Columns:**
  - Date
  - Stock Prices/Volumes
  - Other related metrics

---

## Preprocessing
The preprocessing steps include:
- Handling missing values
- Parsing and setting the **Date** column as the index
- Data type conversions
- Outlier detection and treatment
- Preparing the dataset for EDA and detailed time series analysis

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves the following:
- Visualizing stock trends over time
- Analyzing distributions of key metrics
- Identifying correlations between features
- Generating meaningful plots:
  - Line plots for trends
  - Histogram and KDE plots for distributions
  - Heatmaps for correlations

---

## Time Series Analysis
The time series analysis covers:
- Plotting trends over time
- Decomposing time series data (trend, seasonality, residuals)
- Stationarity tests (ADF Test)
- Smoothing techniques (e.g., Moving Averages)
- Insights into seasonality or recurring patterns
- Model Selection and Implementation

---

## Key Insights
Some of the key insights derived from this analysis include:
- Overall trend in the stock prices
- Impact of seasonal changes on trends
- Identification of any anomalies or significant patterns

---

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib**/**Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Statsmodels**: Time series decomposition and analysis
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Execution environment
